PyCli
=====

Usage
-----

.. code:: bash

  $ pcli generate project "my new project"

ToDo
----

* Generating projects and classes is still broken (generated names are wrong)
  - seems to be ok now using inflection package, have to check more cases
* generate module will write version to __init__.py, should move that stuff to `pycli new ...`
* Config management via cli
* More stuff
* Tests
